# -----Issue Summary-----:
---
On May 1st, 2023, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM (PST), our web application experienced a partial outage that affected 25% of our users. During this time, users were unable to complete transactions on our e-commerce platform, resulting in lost revenue and frustrated customers.

### Timeline:

`9:00 AM:` The issue was detected through multiple customer complaints on social media.
`9:05 AM:` The on-call engineer was alerted through our monitoring system and began investigating.
`9:10 AM:` The engineer found that the database was experiencing high CPU usage and immediately restarted it.
`9:20 AM:` The restart did not resolve the issue, and the engineer began investigating further.
`9:30 AM:` The engineer discovered that the server hosting the database had run out of disk space due to a large influx of user data.
`9:35 AM:` The engineer worked on clearing up disk space by deleting unnecessary data, but this did not immediately resolve the issue.
`10:00 AM:` The incident was escalated to the entire engineering team, and they began working together to diagnose and fix the issue.
`10:30 AM:` The team discovered that the root cause of the issue was a bug in the code that caused an infinite loop while processing user data, resulting in the database overload.
`10:45 AM:` The team fixed the bug and deployed the new code to production.
`11:00 AM:` The issue was resolved, and the application was fully functional.

### Root Cause and Resolution:
---
The root cause of the issue was a bug in the code that caused an infinite loop while processing user data, resulting in the database overload. The team fixed the bug by implementing a new algorithm that prevented the infinite loop from occurring.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
---
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1. Regular database maintenance and monitoring to prevent disk space issues.
1. Code review and testing to catch potential infinite loop bugs.
1. Increase capacity and redundancy of our database to handle large influxes of user data.
1. Implement automatic scaling of the database to handle sudden traffic spikes.

### Tasks to address the issue:
---

1. Review and update our database maintenance and monitoring procedures.
1. Implement code review and testing procedures.
1. Upgrade our database to handle increased capacity and redundancy.
1. Implement automatic scaling of our database.
1. In conclusion, this partial outage was caused by a bug in our code that caused an infinite loop while processing user data.
The incident was resolved within two hours, but it resulted in lost revenue and frustrated customers. To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, we will implement new procedures for database maintenance and monitoring, code review and testing, and upgrade our database capacity and redundancy.
